### I am currently learning swiftUI, for now: this are some notes


#### Everything is a view

The structure of them is as followed:
```
struct NewView: View {
    @State var stateVar: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        //View content
    }
}
```

Variables that can be changed by the UI elements, are marked width: 
```
@State
